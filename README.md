Microkernel OS designed for home/server use

## About
This OS is made by some Russian guys

## P.S
To build OS from source, write "make" in the terminal and wait for the complete build.
If you yourself updated or fix OS, then you need to write "make clean" in the terminal and wait until all object files are deleted, after that you can write "make" and get the current build of the system
